	<h1>Songtext with DIV and SPAN</h1>
	<h3>Here we worked with DIV and PRE</h3>
	<div><pre><p>
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let's go
Yeah, <br>let's go, hahaha
Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yup
	</pre></div>

Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track buzzing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment		
	</pre></div>
	<div><pre>
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
	</pre></div>
	<h3>Here we worked with SPAN und PRE</h3>
	<span><pre>
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us</pre></span>
	<div><pre>
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oooh, let's go
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Oooooh, and all my people say
	</pre></div>
	<div><pre>
Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-oh-oh-oh-oh-more
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us</p>
